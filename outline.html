	  Course Evaluation
	</h2>
	<p>
	  Please note that all assignments (theoretical and lab) will
	  be placed on the website (linked from
	  the <a href="#schedule">schedule table</a>); no hardcopies
	  of the assignments will be distributed in class. All
	  assignments must be submitted
	  through <a href="https://moodle.concordia.ca/moodle/course/view.php?id=92362"
	  target="_blank" >Moodle</a>. Deadlines are set to Friday
	  11:55pm (see exact dates
	  on <a href="#schedule">schedule</a>). A grace period of 2
	  days will be granted, i.e., assignments could be submitted
	  until Sunday 11:55pm. <strong>No assignment will be accepted
	  beyond the grace period</strong>.
	</p>
	<ol>
	  <li><strong>Lab Assignments</strong>
	    (<strong>LA1</strong>, <strong>LA2</strong>, <strong>LA3</strong>):
	    <strong>20%</strong>: You will be required to develop some
	    protocol software. There will be a total of 3 lab
	    assignments. You must submit, and pass, at least 2 of these
	    3 assignments in order to pass the course. You can work on
	    these assignments individually or in a team of two (teams
	    cannot exceed 2 students). A team has to submit only one
	    copy of the assignment by one of the members.<br/>
	    Assignments must be <strong>archived in a ZIP file</strong>
	    using your ID(s) and last name(s) as file name. The ZIP file
	    must contain the code related to the assignment and a README
	    text file explaining how to use it (including compilation
	    instructions if necessary).<br/>A <strong>demo</strong>
	    for about 10 minutes will take place between the group
	    members and the marker. Different marks may be assigned to
	    teammates based on the markers judgment. The demo time will
	    be determined and announced by the markers,
	    and <strong>students must reserve</strong> a particular time
	    slot for the demo</strong> (arrange directly with the
markers) . No demo means zero marks for the assignment.  No
additional marks will be given for working individually.
</li>
<li>
  <strong>Mid-term exam</strong>: <strong>20%</strong>: The exam
  is a closed-book exam, and will be conducted on <strong>March
    1st</strong>. In general, you will need to bring your own ENCS
  calculator; the same rule also applies to the final
  exam. Additionally, and as a general rule for exams, you need
  to show all your work (just the final result is not
  enough). There is no substitution for a missed exam.
</li>
<li>
  <strong>Final exam</strong>: <strong>60%</strong>: The exam is
  a closed-book exam. The final exam date will be set by the
  University Administration. The exam will cover material from
  the entire semester, including lectures, textbook, and
  assignments. Passing the final exam is necessary for passing
  the course. There is no substitution for a missed final exam.
</li>
<li>
  <strong>Theoretical
    Assignments</strong>(<strong>TA1</strong>, <strong>TA2</strong>, <strong>TA3</strong>):
  There will be a total of 3 theoretical assignments. These
  assignments <strong>will not be marked</strong> and hence may not evaluate
  to any load of the course. The main purpose behind these
  assignments is to provide you with good preparation for
  the mid-term and final. These assignments are individual
  assignments (no groups are allowed). All assignments must
  be typed: hand-written (or scanned)
  assignments will be rejected.
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Grading Scheme</strong>: There is no standard relationship
  between percentages and letter grades assigned. The grading of the
  course will be done based on the relative percentages assigned to the
  assignments and the exams. For reasons of fairness, we may choose to
  scale up/down the marks in a particular exam, or assignment to ensure
  that all aspects of the course receive a fair weight. Any such
  "fine-tuning" will be made known to you before the final grades are
  assessed. Finally, there are no pre-set cutoff points for the final
  grades; the cutoff points will be decided based on an assessment of
  difficulty level, class performance, fairness, and instructor's wisdom
  from teaching and grading the course in the past. That is, there is no
  definite rule for translation of number grades to letter grades.

    Academic Integrity
  </h2>

  Violation of the Academic Code of Conduct in any form will be
  severely dealt with. This includes copying (even with modifications)
  of program segments. You must demonstrate independent thought through
  your submitted work.  Click on the following link for more
