# Networks course

This is the repository of the COMP 445 course that I teach at
Concordia University in Winter 2018. This repository contains the
source files that I use to prepare the course outline, assignments and
exams. The master branch contains material for the current year. The
other branches contain material used in previous years.

## Disclaimers

For Concordia students:
